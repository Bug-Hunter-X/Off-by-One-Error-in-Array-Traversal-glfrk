This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array.  The initial code attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The solution provides the corrected code with proper bounds checking.  This is a fundamental error to watch out for when working with arrays in any programming language.
